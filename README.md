This repo is for all the works I've done in class Stats507.
There is a script named as 'PS2 Q3', which is the code subtracted from Problem set 2, Question 3(which has some problems in it, I hope it will not be regarded when grading.)
The link to the script is

And for special illustration:see https://github.com/umichpengfeil/Stats507/blob/main/GSIcomments.md for GSI comments of Q3.
